# WoofingJace NFT Batch Transfer

A cyberpunk-inspired web application for batch transferring NFTs on the BNB Chain. This tool allows users to connect their MetaMask wallet, approve an NFT contract, and transfer multiple NFTs to various addresses in a single transaction.

## Features

- **NFT Viewer**: Displays owned NFTs with metadata (name, image, token ID) fetched from the contract.
- **Single NFT Transfer**: Allows individual NFT transfers to a specified address.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile with a neon-lit, cyberpunk aesthetic inspired by WoofingJace.
